# The News Literacy Toolkit

I created this project from scratch -- writing, building, designing, etc. it -- as a finalist for the Reynold's Journalism Institute's 2022 student innovation competition. This project was completed entirely from scratch over the course of five months.

I taught myself ReactJS and its adjacent libraries in order to build this website. It is currently in the process of being updated for final submissions later this spring. The website is a static build and is responsive on all devices. I used a mix of animation libraries, such as React Spring, as well as DataWrapper to accomplish a lot of my features. 

The aim was to create a hub for students to explore the meaning, and importance, of journalism in an interactive way. This was an extremely labor intensive project, so I greatly appreciate you taking the time to look over my code and live site.

Please feel free to contact me at danacassidy1@gmail.com with any questions or thoughts about the project. Thanks!
