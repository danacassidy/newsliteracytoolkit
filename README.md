# The News Literacy Toolkit

I created this project from scratch -- writing, building, designing, etc. it -- as a finalist for the Reynold's Journalism Institute's 2022 student innovation competition. 

I taught myself ReactJS and its adjacent libraries in order to build this website. It is currently in the process of being updated for final submissions later this spring. The website is a static build and is responsive on all devices. The aim was to create a hub for students to explore the meaning, and importance, of journalism in an interactive way.

I enjoy having everything where I can see it, hence why there is a lot of in-line CSS alongside my CSS sheets. It's a habit i'm trying to break.

Please feel free to contact me at danacassidy1@gmail.com with any questions or thoughts about the project. Thanks!
