# The News Literacy Toolkit

I created this project from scratch -- writing, building, designing, etc. it -- as a finalist for the Reynold's Journalism Institute's 2022 student innovation competition. 

I taught myself ReactJS and its adjacent libraries in order to build this website. It is currently in the process of being updated for final submissions later this spring.

I enjoy having everything where I can see it, hence why there is a lot of in-line CSS alongside my CSS sheets. It's a habit i'm trying to break.

Please feel free to contact me at danacassidy1@gmail.com with any questions or thoughts about the project. Thanks!
